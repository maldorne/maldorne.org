All of them have been text-based role-playing games set in a more or less shared fantasy world, where players can explore diverse regions, complete quests, and engage in epic battles, all through typed commands. This text-based RPGs thrive on storytelling, complex character interactions, immersive role-playing experiences and action-packed combat, both in player versus environment (PvE) and player versus player (PvP) scenarios.
