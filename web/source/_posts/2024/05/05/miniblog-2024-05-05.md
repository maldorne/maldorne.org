*For developers*: The Docker container images we are using for the MUDs we host are not anymore in **Docker Hub**, now they are in the [**Github Container Registry**](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry), just in case anybody want to tests things in their own computers. 

[DGD image](https://github.com/maldorne/dgd/pkgs/container/dgd), [MudOS Images](https://github.com/maldorne/mudos/pkgs/container/mudos). You can always find them in their respective repositories, in the right column, under the `packages` section.
