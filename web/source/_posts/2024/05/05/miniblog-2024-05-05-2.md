The **Hexagon mudlib** has reached at last its `version 2.0`, codenamed **Castle Black**. It's a major release that includes a lot of changes and improvements, and it's the first one that we can say is a beta version, after a lot of years in alpha. It's a renaming of the [v1.24.04 version](https://github.com/maldorne/hexagon/milestone/3). The next planned version will be [v2.1 Daggerfall](https://github.com/maldorne/hexagon/milestone/4).
