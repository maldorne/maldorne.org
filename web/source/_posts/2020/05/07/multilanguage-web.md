~~Just a small note, we've made the maldorne.org web multilanguage, as you can see in the dropdown selector in the upper-right corner. Most of the contents (like this post) are written both in english and spanish, and you just have to change the language to browse the web the way you prefer or understand better.~~

~~By default the chosen language would be english (set when you visit the [maldorne.org](https://maldorne.org) home page).~~

**Updated 5th Nov 2021**: now the web is only in english, with no dropdown and without multiple languages.
