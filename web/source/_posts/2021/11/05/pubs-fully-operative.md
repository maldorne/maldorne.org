The same as shops were reviewed the last month, now pubs have been reviewed and they are operative. You can take a look to the ones included with de Fantasy Demo game:

- `/demo-fantasy/areas/elfereth/rooms/z19.c`
- `/demo-fantasy/areas/erken/rooms/BP.c`
- `/demo-fantasy/areas/naduk/rooms/ap.c`

One in every town.


```
The Slaughtered Lamb [-n-].
Arak is here.
Sign.
```

By default, a sign will be added:

```
> read sign
You read a text written in common:

 ┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
 │                                                               │
 │  Food:                                                        │
 │    Ribs               :  3 bronze coins                       │
 │                                                               │
 │  Soft drinks:                                                 │
 │                                                               │
 │  Alcoholic beverages:                                         │
 │    Firewater          :  1 gold coin and 1 silver coin        │
 │    Whisky             :  1 gold coin                          │
 │    Dark Beer          :  3 bronze coins                       │
 │    Liquor             :  2 bronze coins                       │
 │                                                               │
 │  Use 'buy' to ask for what you want.                          │
 │                                                               │
 └───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

And the commands can be used in any pub:

```
> buy liquor
You drink a glass of liquor.
> [ HPs: 172 (172) EPs: 172 (154) ]
```

As you can see, food and drinks will recover partially your health, and alcoholic beverages will also affect your perception, getting your character drunk.
