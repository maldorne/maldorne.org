Trying to add some more useful information to the web, and adding some documentation, this week I made a timeline of the versions of ccmudlib and Hexagon, and added it to the [About page](/about) so you can take a look.

Not very _game-designy_, but is a way of stating the amount of work done during the last years, giving dates and specific versions. Maybe some other time I could add some more information there.
