In the Maldorne non-profit organization we ([we? who are we?](/me)) host several retro-online [games](/games), develop or collaborate in most of them, and create tools and frameworks to help those who are yet working with these technologies.

We created **Ciudad Capital**, the online fantasy game, and have been working on it since 2003.

We are also developing the [**Hexagon** mudlib/framework](https://github.com/maldorne/hexagon/) and tools, which helps developers in creating their own games.

## Timeline

{% timeline %}

{% year "24/25" "Next milestone" "Hexagon v2.1 Daggerfall" %}
The following milestone will include a full revision of communication and movement commands, skills, and the first version of **locations**, an alternative to rooms where data and behavior are separated, making every location fully modifiable and customizable by code, in execution time.
{% endyear %}

{% year "2024" "Stable version" "Hexagon v2.0 Castle Black" %}
The third milestone includes a revision of every command, advances the translation process trying to have every main system in english again, and has finished the first complete demo game: `demo-fantasy`.

It means the move from **alpha** version to a **beta** version, stable and usable enough for other users to create their own games or porting old games from other drivers to `DGD` using `Hexagon`.
{% endyear %}

{% year "2021" "Migrating from older platforms" "Hexagon v1.21.09 Beregost" %}
The second big milestone, `Beregost`, includes a revision of every *initiator object*, the skeleton for the multigame system, continuous integration through [Github Actions](https://github.com/maldorne/hexagon/actions), finishes the conversion of all the remaining basic object types from `ccmudlib`, and includes for the first time a piece of a demo game.

* 25/09/2021 `v1.21.09 Beregost`
{% endyear %}

{% year "2020" "New versioning names" "Hexagon v1.20.09 Anduin" %}
I started working with milestones in Github, naming every big milestone. The first one, `Anduin`, includes the multilanguage system on compilation time (translates contents of files during compilation), separates `user` and `player` objects, and creates the new `login` basic user type to manage connections.

* 01/10/2020 `v1.20.09 Anduin`
{% endyear %}

{% year "2014" "We started moving from MudOS to DGD" "Hexagon v1.19.05" %}
After years of creating content for **Ciudad Capital** using `MudOS` as our MUD driver, I started coding a conversion to the `DGD` driver.

* 07/05/2019 `v1.19.05`
* 27/04/2019 `v1.19.04`
* 14/01/2019 `v1.19.01`
* 18/07/2017 `v1.17.07`
* 26/08/2014 [**First commit**](https://github.com/maldorne/hexagon/commit/4a115fe92941dbee0f8ad5c2a8fcde7b34574aa9) in the `Hexagon` code repository, this was an experiment to see if it was possible to use the `DGD` driver, and evolved with the idea of being the second version of **Ciudad Capital**.
{% endyear %}

{% year "2012" "Work goes on with ccmudlib" "ccmudlib v0.8" %}
Some more working on `ccmudlib` and **Ciudad Capital**, now in professional hostings (OVH and AWS during different years).

* 03/2012 `v0.8`
* 11/2011 `v0.7.1`
* 12/2010 `v0.7`
* ??/2010 `v0.6.2`
* ??/2010 `v0.6.1`
* 02/2010 `v0.6`
* 18/12/2009 `v0.5`
{% endyear %}

{% year "2009" "Final year project in Software Engineering" "ccmudlib v0.4" %}
`ccmudlib v0.4` was the foundation for my final year project in **Software Engineering** (BSc and MSc) at Universidad Polit√©cnica de Madrid.

* 01/12/2009 **Final year project**.
{% endyear %}

{% year "2009" "First versions of the mudlib and the game" "ccmudlib v0.3" %}
For some years I just work on the MUD from time to time, adding features and content to the game, still hosted in a dedicated machine in my own home.

* 13/05/2009 `v0.4`
* 27/04/2009 `v0.3.6`
* 25/03/2009 `v0.3.5`
* 04/08/2008 `v0.3.4`
* 07/07/2005 `v0.3.3`
* 26/10/2004 `v0.3.2`
* 19/12/2003 `v0.3.1`
* 13/07/2003 `v0.3`
* 01/07/2003 `v0.2`
{% endyear %}

{% year "2003" "Started coding my own game: Ciudad Capital" "ccmudlib v0.1" %}
Some time after _Reinos de Leyenda_ closed its doors, I started coding my own game, based in some of the latest features I was working on for the new mudlib, creating a new world and lore.

* 17/01/2003 **First login** to the new game.
{% endyear %}

{% year "1998" "Knowing about MUDs" "Beginnings..." "last" %}
Some time around maybe 1998, I started playing in the _Reinos de Leyenda_ MUD, and I fell in love with text-based games. I played with several classes/guilds, and after some time I became a `creator` (coder) and went up in the hierarchy up to `alchemist` (lesser admin).

With some other coders we started working in a hard-core revision of the codebase, updating the driver version, but the MUD would disappear before the new mudlib could open to the public.
