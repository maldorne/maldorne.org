    version: Hexagon v1.23.03 Castle Black
    title: Next milestone
    content: |
      The third milestone, still a work in progress, includes a revision of every command, advances the translation process trying to have every main system in english again, and has finished the first complete demo game: `demo-fantasy`.

      It will mean the move from **alpha** version to a **beta** version, stable and usable enough for other users to create their own games or porting old games from other drivers to `DGD` using `Hexagon`.

    version: Hexagon v1.21.09 Beregost
    title: Stable version
    content: |
      The second big milestone, `Beregost`, includes a revision of every *initiator object*, the skeleton for the multigame system, continuous integration through [Github Actions](https://github.com/maldorne/hexagon/actions), finishes the conversion of all the remaining basic object types from `ccmudlib`, and includes for the first time a piece of a demo game.

      * 25/09/2021 `v1.21.09 Beregost`

    version: Hexagon v1.20.09 Anduin
    title: New versioning names
    content: |
      I started working with milestones in Github, naming every big milestone. The first one, `Anduin`, includes the multilanguage system on compilation time (translates contents of files during compilation), separates `user` and `player` objects, and creates the new `login` basic user type to manage connections.

      * 01/10/2020 `v1.20.09 Anduin`

    version: Hexagon v1.19.05
    title: We started moving from MudOS to DGD
    content: |
      After years of creating content for **Ciudad Capital** using `MudOS` as our MUD driver, I started coding a conversion to the `DGD` driver.

      * 07/05/2019 `v1.19.05`
      * 27/04/2019 `v1.19.04`
      * 14/01/2019 `v1.19.01`
      * 18/07/2017 `v1.17.07`
      * 26/08/2014 [**First commit**](https://github.com/maldorne/hexagon/commit/4a115fe92941dbee0f8ad5c2a8fcde7b34574aa9) in the `Hexagon` code repository, this was an experiment to see if it was possible to use the `DGD` driver, and evolved with the idea of being the second version of **Ciudad Capital**.

    version: ccmudlib v0.1
    title: "Started coding my own game: Ciudad Capital"
    content: |
      Some time after _Reinos de Leyenda_ closed its doors, I started coding my own game, based in some of the latest features I was working on for the new mudlib, creating a new world and lore.

      * 17/01/2003 **First login** to the new game.

    title: Knowing about MUDs
    content: |
      Some time around maybe 1998, I started playing in the _Reinos de Leyenda_ MUD, and I fell in love with text-based games. I played with several classes/guilds, and after some time I became a `creator` (coder) and went up in the hierarchy up to `alchemist` (lesser admin).

      With some other coders we started working in a hard-core revision of the codebase, updating the driver version, but the MUD would disappear before the new mudlib could open to the public.

In the Maldorne non-profit organization we ([we? who are we?](/me)) host several retro-online [games](/games), develop or collaborate in most of them, and create tools and frameworks to help those who are yet working with these technologies.

We created **Ciudad Capital**, the online fantasy game, and have been working on it since 2003.

We are also developing the [**Hexagon** mudlib/framework](https://github.com/maldorne/hexagon/) and tools, which helps developers in creating their own games.
